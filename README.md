# hello-world
A starter repository to knock the rust off. 

I'm a work in progress. I like to think that I'm behind in life because I'll always grow, kinda like a slow and steady person. That may just be what I tell myself so I I can live with myself and sleep at night. At this moment it is neither the truth or a lie, just something I believe. Only time will tell if I make the most of the life I end up living. Something that is ture is that I've spent a lot of time just passing time. I've also let many good opportunities pass me by for one reason or another. I've also really enjoyed certain aspects of life. I've had a lot of fun, which is important to me. I've learned a lot and also realized that I don't know a lot. It's hard for me to listen to myself becasue I tell myself to be quiet a lot. I hope that my voice can regain it's volume inside my head so that I can lead myself through life without regret and more importantly with memories that I can hope to share with others to inspire them to live their lives with greater purpose. 

Also I'd like to be a better developer so I made a github :)
